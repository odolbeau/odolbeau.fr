I make software and write [blog posts][]. I give [talks][] and help organize events, like [ForumPHP][].

I work for [BlaBlaCar][] as a web architect.

I drink beers and attend concerts.

I try to contribute as much as possible in open source (checkout my [Github profile][]).

Don't hesitate to [contact me][]. :)
