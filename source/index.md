# What I do

When I'm not chilling in bars or attending concerts, I work for [BlaBlaCar][] as a web architect after a few years on the development side.

I enjoy sharing my experience, that's why I wrote some [articles][] and gave a few [talks][].

I try to contribute as much as possible in open source (checkout my [Github profile][]).
